		<h1>This is the header area of the three-column-plus-header layout</h1>
	</div>
		<div id="left">
			<p>This is quite straight -forward. Using the abosolute positioning,
this column has its upper left corner placed 10 pixels down from thetop of the documnet
area of the browser and 10 pixels to the right of the left margin of that space.
It sets a fixed width for the column, though as we will see, you could supply a relative 
value (such as a percentage) to create a stretchy layout that would keep the 
left column's width proportional to the documnet area's width.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="center">
			<p> Notice that this column is not able to be positioned. Its position will thus remain its 
"natural" place based on its location in the HTML file that generates the page.
Margin setting ensure that the right and left columnns(which are set to 200 pixelin width) will 
have room for their content without creating visible space between any of the adjoining columns
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="right">
			<p>This is also quite straight -forward. This is very much like left column.Like left column 
this uses absolute positioning.

		</div>

	
	<div id="footer">
		<p>The footer should float below the three columns.</p>
